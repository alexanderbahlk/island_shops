# As with config/credentials.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,
# like your database password, in your source code. If your source code is
# ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your database.
#
# Instead, provide the password or a full connection URL as an environment
# variable when you boot the app. For example:
#
#   DATABASE_URL="postgres://myuser:mypass@localhost/somedatabase"
#
# If provided, a database URL will override the host, port, username, and password
# settings above. The URL scheme must be either "postgres" or "postgresql".
#
# You can use this database configuration with:
#
#   production:
#     url: <%= ENV["DATABASE_URL"] %>
#
production:
